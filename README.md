## ✨What is Python ???✨
*Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.*

- **Designed by :** Guido Van Rossum.

- **Developer :** Python Software Foundation.

- **First appeared :** 20 February 1991 ; 31 years ago.

- **OS :** Windows, macOS, Linux/UNIX, Android and more.

## ✨Why is it called Python ?✨
While many people assume the name Python Programming comes from something related to the Python snake, it actually comes from the TV comedy series ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus.’ This series broadcast on the BBC channel in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and was a favorite of Guido Van Rossum’s. Because it was short, cryptic, and included the name of his favorite TV comedy show, he chose the name ‘Python.

## ✨What type of language is Python ?✨
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.

## ✨What is Python used for ? ✨
Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.

## ✨Merits of Python✨
 - Presence of third-party modules.
 - Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics, etc.)
 - Open source and large active community base.
 - Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write.
 - User-friendly data structures.
 - High-level language.

## ✨Future of Python✨
The future of Python is thus set in stone as the go-to language for developers engaging in deep machine learning projects, companies looking to scale up by using big data analytics or efforts aimed at achieving social applications of automation.

## ✨Wide Range of Aspects✨
Python is a general-purpose programming language. In fact, it can be used in a wide range of coding scenarios like web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, internet of things and many more.
